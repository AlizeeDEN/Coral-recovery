Dataset Abstract

	In this study, coral recruitment was measured on a kilometer-wide scale on
				shallow (5–6 m depth) fringing reefs in St. John, US Virgin Islands, with the
				objective of determining the extent to which variation in recruitment was affected
				by biophysical coupling involving temperature and flow. Coral recruitment was
				measured using settlement tiles deployed at 10 sites along 10 km of shore. The tiles
				were first deployed in August 2006, and thereafter replaced every ≈6 months to
				sample from either August to January, or January to August over 2 years. Seawater
				temperature was recorded at the 10 sites using logging thermistors, and flow was
				quantified using drogues. Overall, corals recruited at a rate equivalent to 76
				corals m− 2 6 months− 1, and were represented mostly by poritids (43% of recruits),
				agaricids (29%), faviids (17%) and siderastreids (7%). Although the density of
				recruits differed among sites in a pattern that varied among periods and years,
				there was a consistent trend for mean density to decline from ≈ 4 corals tile− 1 at
				eastern sites, to ≤ 1 coral tile− 1 at western sites. One aspect of seawater
				temperature – the daily range – differed among sites and was greater at western
				compared to eastern sites, and while it was related inversely to recruitment over
				one of the sampling periods, it was equivocal as a physical process affecting
				recruitment. Instead, our results are consistent with biophysical coupling involving
				patch depletion and downstream filtering, whereby patches of coral larvae are
				delivered to the south shore of St. John and depleted of larvae through settlement
				as the water progresses westward.
