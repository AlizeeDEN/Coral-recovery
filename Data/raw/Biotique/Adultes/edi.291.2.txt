Dataset Abstract

	These data are evidence of the the long-term dynamics of shallow coral reefs along
				the south coast of St. John from as early as 1987. These data describe coral reef
				community structure as percent cover based on the analysis of color photographs. All
				of these data originate from color images of photoquadrats recorded annually
				(usually in the summer) from as early as 1987. The data falls into three groups. The
				two groups that are contained in this data package are (1) Tektite & Yawzi and
				(2) Random sites. The juvenile coral density is packaged separately. 
	 Tektite – this is at 14 m depth on the eastern side of Great Lameshur Bay and is
				the original site of the Tektite man-in-the sea project in 1969; this project marked
				the birth of the Virgin Islands Ecological Research Station (later the Virgin
				Islands Environmental Resource Station) that hosts the field component of the
				project. The reef in this location consists of a single buttress that has remained
				dominated by Montastraea anularis since the start of the research (1987). These
				surveys consist of 30 photoquadrats (1 x 1 m) distributed along three, 10 m
				transects. 
	 Yawzi – this is at 9 m depth and is on the western side of Great Lameshur Bay and
				has been recorded photographically since 1987. This reef also started the study
				period dominated by Montastraea annularis, but has degraded much more rapidly that
				the Tektite site. These surveys consist of 30 photoquadrats (1 x 1 m) distributed
				along three, 10 m transects. 
	 Random sites – were added in 1992 to address the concern that the original sites
				(Yawzi and Tektite) were selected on “good” areas of reef and, therefore, could only
				decline in condition. The Random sites were selected using random coordinates in
				1992, and consist of 6 sites (at 7-9 m depth) scattered between Cabritte Point and
				White Point. All lie a little shoreward of Yawzi and Tektite, and have always been
				characterized by low coral cover (< 10% cover). The surveys consist of 18-40
				photoquadrats (0.5 x 0.5 m; with sample size determined by the exposures on a 35 mm
				cassette versus digital techniques) that are placed at random points along a
				transect.
