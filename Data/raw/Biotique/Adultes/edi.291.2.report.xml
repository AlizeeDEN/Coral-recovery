      <description>Look for entity size element as a prep for checking congruence, and if not present, generate a warn.

      in the physical/authentication element to the checksum/hash value of this entity downloaded from previous revisions of this data package. If PASTA already has a copy of this entity, it will be able 
      to avoid an unnecessary download of the entity from your site, resulting in faster processing of the new data package revision when you update it in PASTA.</explanation>
